# Unpaidwork

Welcome to unpaidwork. This CLI gem was made to provide the user with data from the OECD and also to showcase what I've learned so far in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'unpaidwork'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install unpaidwork

## Usage

This CLI is not intended for official purposes. It is simply providing data that is found on the OECD website. A full view of the data representd in this CLI can be found here: https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=54757

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
